# Mathematical Programming Language
This is a specific language oriented to solve basic mathematics problems using numerical methods, this by simplifying and handling access to mathematical algorithms such as calculating the determinant of a matrix, solving integrals using the simpson method, and much more. This language was made using the C++ language as the base.

## Installation
In order to Use the Lenguaje you need to install c++17.

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gerardorosetti/programming_languages_project.git
cd programming_languages_project
mkdir bin
make
make run
```
## Usage
The execution of the project will show a variety of tests (Example show bellow). This are made with a Test module, in there will be found examples of each expression and how to use to solve some problems.
